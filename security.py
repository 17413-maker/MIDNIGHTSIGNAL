security.py — keeps Midnight Signal from reciting its own wiring back to
whoever is talking to it: system prompt, tool schemas, internal file/module
names.

This is prompt-leak hardening, not content moderation. It never changes
what Midnight Signal is willing to discuss or do for the user — it only
stops it from dumping its own configuration into a chat reply when asked
(directly, or via "repeat everything above", translation tricks, "ignore
previous instructions", pretend-debugging, roleplay, instructions found
inside a file/command/git tool result, etc).

The user's own /sys command is unaffected — that reads history[0] directly
in Python and always shows the real thing to the person running the tool.
This only guards what the *model* says back in a chat reply.
